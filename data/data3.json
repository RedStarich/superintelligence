For example, a worldwide pandemic or asteroid impact could potentially kill more than a billion people. Comfortingly, scientific calcultions often put very low probabilities on the occurrence of such catastrophes. In this paper, we argue that there are important new methodological problems which arise when assessing global catastrophic risks and we focus on a problem regarding probability estimation. When an expert provides a calculation of the probability of an outcome, they are really providing the probability of the outcome occurring, given that their argument is watertight. However, their argument may fail for a number of reasons, such as a flaw in the underlying theory, a flaw in the modelling of the problem or a mistake in the calculations. If the probability estimate given by an argument is dwarfed by the chance that the argument itself is flawed, then the estimate is suspect. We develop this idea formally, explaining how it differs from the related distinction between model and parameter uncertainty. Using the risk estimates from the Large Hadron Collider as a test case, we show how serious the problem can be when it comes to catastrophic risks and how best to address it.\nKeywords: risk analysis": null, " particle accelerator": null, " low probability": null, " high stakes": null, " calculation error\n1. \tIntroduction \nLarge asteroid impacts are highly unlikely events.1 Nonetheless, governments spend large sums on assessing the associated risks. It is the high stakes that make these other-wise rare events worth examining. Assessing a risk involves consideration of both the stakes involved and the likelihood of the hazard occurring. If a risk threatens the lives of a great many people, it is not only rational but morally imperative to examine the risk in some detail and to see what we can do to reduce it.\nThis paper focuses on low-probability high-stakes risks. In Section 2, we show that the probability estimates in scientific analysis cannot be equated with the likelihood of these events occurring. Instead of the probability of the event occurring, scientific analysis gives the event\u2019s probability conditioned on the given argument being sound. Though this is the case in all probability estimates, we show how it becomes crucial when the estimated probabilities are smaller than a certain threshold.\n*Corresponding author. Email: toby.ord@philosophy.ox.ac.uk\nISSN 1366-9877 print/ISSN 1466-4461 online\n\u00a9 2010 Taylor & Francis \nDOI: 10.1080/13669870903126267 \nhttp://www.informaworld.com\n\n192\t T. Ord et al.\nTo proceed, we need to know something about the reliability of the argument. To do so, risk analysis commonly falls back on the distinction between model and param-eter uncertainty. We argue that this dichotomy is not well suited for incorporating information about the reliability of the theories involved in the risk assessment. Furthermore, the distinction does not account for mistakes made unknowingly. In Section 3, we therefore propose a three-fold distinction between an argument\u2019s theory, its model and its calculations. While explaining this distinction in more detail, we illustrate it with historic examples of errors in each of the three areas. We indicate how specific risk assessment can make use of the proposed theory\u2013model\u2013calculation distinction in order to evaluate the reliability of the given argument and thus improve the reliability of their probability estimate for rare events.\nRecently, concerns have been raised that high-energy experiments in particle physics, such as the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory or the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, may threaten humanity. If these fears are justified, these experiments pose a risk to humanity that can be avoided by simply not turning on the experiment. In Section 4, we use the methods of this paper to address the current debate on the safety of experiments within particle physics. We evaluate current reports in the light of our findings and give suggestions for future research.\nThe final section brings the debate back to the general issue of assessing low-prob-ability risk. We stress that the findings in this paper are not to be interpreted as an argument for anti-intellectualism, but rather as arguments for making the noisy and fallible nature of scientific and technical research subject to intellectual reasoning, especially in situations where the probabilities are very low and the stakes are very high.\n2. \tProbability estimates\nSuppose you read a report which examines a potentially catastrophic risk and concludes that the probability of catastrophe is one in a billion. What probability should you assign to the catastrophe occurring? We argue that direct use of the report\u2019s estimate of one in a billion is naive. This is because the report\u2019s authors are not infallible and their argument might have a hidden flaw. What the report has told us is not the probability of the catastrophe occurring, but the probability of the catastrophe occurring, given that the included argument is sound.\n\tEven if the argument looks watertight, the chance that it contains a critical flaw may well be much larger than one in a billion. After all, in a sample of a billion appar-ently watertight arguments you are likely to see many that have hidden flaws. Our best estimate of the probability of catastrophe may thus end up noticeably higher than the report\u2019s estimate.2 \n\tLet us use the following notation: X, the catastrophe occurs": null, " A, the argument is sound": null, " P(X), the probability of X and P(X|A), the probability of X given A.\nWhile we are actually interested in P(X), the report provides us only with an esti-mate of P(X|A), since it cannot fully take into account the possibility that it is in error.3,4 From the axioms of probability theory, we know that P(X) is related to P(X|A) by the following formula: \nP X\n)\n": null, " however in this paper, we are specifically looking at cases where there is an extremely low value of P(X|A), so practically any value of P(X|\u00acA) will be higher and thus drive the combined probability estimate upwards. The situation is symmetric with regard to extremely high estimates of P(X|A), where increased uncertainty about the argument will reduce the probability estimate, the symmetry is broken only by our focus on arguments which claim that an event is very unlikely.\nAnother possible objection is that since there is always a non-zero probability of the argument being flawed, the situation is hopeless: any new argument will be unable to remove the grey area completely. It is true that the grey area can never be completely removed": null, " however, if a new argument (A2) is independent of the previous argument (A1), then the grey area will shrink, for P(\u00acA1, \u00acA2) < P(\u00acA1). This can allow for significant progress. A small remaining grey area can be acceptable if P(X|\u00acA) P(\u00acA) is estimated to be sufficiently small in comparison to the stakes.\n3. \tTheories, models and calculations\nThe most common way to assess the reliability of an argument is to distinguish between model and parameter uncertainty and assign reliabilities to these choices. While this distinction has certainly been of use in many practical cases, it is unneces-sarily crude for the present purpose, failing to account for potential errors in the paper\u2019s calculations or a failure of the background theory.\n\nFigure 2.\nWays in which risk assessments can be flawed.\nJournal of Risk Research\n195\nIn order to account for all possible mistakes in the argument, we look separately at its theory, its model and its calculations. The calculations evaluate a concrete model representing the processes under consideration, for example the formation of black holes in a particle collision, the response of certain climate parameters (such as mean temperature or precipitation rate) to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations or the response of economies to changes in the oil price. These models are mostly derived from more general theories. In what follows, we do not restrict the term \u2018theory\u2019 to well-established and mathematically elaborate theories like electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics or relativity theory. Rather, theories are understood to include theo-retical background knowledge, such as specific research paradigms or the generally accepted research practice within a field (see Figure 2). An example is the efficient market hypothesis which underlies many models within economics, such as the Black-Scholes model.\nFigure 2.\nWe consider adequate models or theories rather than correct ones. For example, Ways in which risk assessments can be flawed.\nwe wish to allow that Newtonian mechanics is an adequate theory in many situations, while recognizing that in some cases it is clearly inadequate (such as for calculating the electron orbitals). We thus call a representation of some system adequate if it is able to predict the relevant system features at the required precision. For example, if climate modellers wish to determine the implications our greenhouse gas emissions will have on the well-being of future generations, their model/theory will not be adequate unless it tells them the changes in the local temperature and precipitation. In contrast, a model might only need to tell them changes in global temperature and precipitation to be adequate for answering less sensitive questions. On a theoretical level, much more could be said about this distinction between adequacy and correctness, but for the purposes of evaluating the reliability of risk assessment, the explanation above should suffice.\nWith the following notation: T, the involved theories are adequate": null, " M, the derived model is adequate": null, " and C, the calculations are correct, we can represent P(A) as P(T, M, C). We can then benefit from the theory\u2013model\u2013calculation distinction by express-ing this as the product of three separate probabilities, each of which should be easier to estimate than P(A). Firstly, from the laws of conditional probability, it follows that P(T, M, C) ": null, " Stubbs, Haw, and Taylor 2006": null, " Walsh et al. 2008), with a median of roughly 5% of administrations. Of these errors, 15\u201340% were dose errors, giving an overall dose error rate of about 1\u20132%.\nWhat does this mean for error rates in risk estimation? Since the stakes are high when it comes to dosing errors, this data represents a serious attempt to get the right answer in a life or death circumstance. It is likely that the people doing risk estimation are more reliable at arithmetic than health professionals and have more time for error correction, but it appears unlikely that they would be more reliable in many orders of magnitude. Hence, a chance of 10\u22123 for a mistake per simple calculation does not seem unreasonable. A random sample of papers from Nature and the British Medical Journal found that roughly 11% of statistical results were flawed, largely due to rounding and transcription errors (Garc\u00eda-Berthou and Alcaraz 2004).\nCalculation errors include more than just the \u2018simple\u2019 slips which we know from school, such as confusing units, forgetting a negative square root or incorrectly tran-scribing from the line above. Instead, many mistakes arise here due to numerical implementation of the analytic mathematical equations. Computer-based simulations and numerical analysis are rarely straightforward. The history of computers contains\n\nJournal of Risk Research \t197\na large number of spectacular failures due to small mistakes in hardware or software. The 4 June 1996 explosion of an Ariane 5 rocket was due to a leftover piece of code triggering a cascade of failures (ESA 1996). Audits of spreadsheets in real world use find error rates on the order of 88% (Panko 1998). The 1993 Intel Pentium floating point error affected 3\u20135 million processors, reducing their numeric reliability and hence our confidence in anything calculated with them (Nicely 2008). Programming errors can remain dormant for a long time even in apparently correct code, only to emerge under extreme conditions. An elementary and widely used binary search algo-rithm included in the standard libraries for Java was found after nine years to contain a bug that emerges only when searching very large lists (Bloch 2006). A mistake in data processing led to the retraction of five high-profile protein structure papers as the handedness of the molecules had become inverted (Miller 2006).\nIn cases where computational methods are used in modelling, many mistakes cannot be avoided. Discrete approximations of the often continuous model equations are used, and in some cases we know that the discrete version is not a good proxy for the continuous model (Morawetz and Walke 2003). Moreover, numerical evaluations are often done on a discrete computational grid, with the values inside the meshes being approximated from the values computed at the grid points. Though we know that certain extrapolation schemes are more reliable in some cases than others, we are often unable to exclude the possibility of error, or to even quantify it.\n3.2. \tWays of modelling and theorizing\nOur distinction between model and theory follows the typical use of the terms within mathematical sciences like physics or economics. Whereas theories are associated with broad applicability and higher confidence in the correctness of their description, models are closer to the phenomena. For example, when estimating the probability of a particular asteroid colliding with the Earth, one would use either Newtonian mechanics or general relativity as a theory for describing the role of gravity. One could then use this theory in conjunction with observations of the bodies\u2019 positions, velocities and masses to construct a model, and finally, one could perform a series of calculations based on this model to estimate the probability of impact. As this shows, the errors that can be introduced in settling for a specific model include and surpass those which are sometimes referred to as parameter uncertainty. As well as questions of the individual parameters (positions, velocities and masses), there are important questions of detail (Can we neglect the inner structure of the involved bodies?), and breadth (Can we focus on the Earth and asteroid only, or do we have to model other planets, or the Sun?).7 \n\tAs can be seen from this example, one way to distinguish theories from models is that theories are too general to be applied directly to the problem. For any given theory, there are many ways to apply it to the problem and these ways give rise to different models. Philosophers of science will note that our theory\u2013model distinction is in accordance with the non-uniform notion used by Giere (1999), Morrison (1998), Cartwright (1999), and others, but differs from that of the semantic interpretation of theories (Suppes 1957).\nWe should also note that it is quite possible for an argument to involve several theories or several models. This complicates the analysis and typically provides addi-tional ways for the argument to be flawed.8 For example, in estimating the risk of black hole formation at the LHC, we not only require quantum chromodynamics (the\n\n198\t T. Ord et al.\ntheory on which the LHC is built to test), but also relativity and Hawking\u2019s theory of black hole radiation. In addition to their other roles, modelling assumptions also have to explain how to glue such different theories together (Hillerbrand and Ghil 2008).\nIn risk assessment, the systems involved are most often not as well understood as asteroid impacts. Often, various models exist simultaneously \u2013 all known to be incom-plete or incorrect in some way, but difficult to improve upon.9 Particularly in these cases, having an expected or desired outcome in mind while setting up a model makes one vulnerable to expectation bias: the tendency to reach the desired answer rather than the correct one. This bias has affected many of science\u2019s great names (Jeng 2006), and in the case of risk assessment, the desire for a \u2018positive\u2019 outcome (safety in the case of the advocate or danger in the case of the protestor) seems a likely cause of bias in modelling.\n3.3. \tHistorical examples of model and theory failure\nA dramatic example of a model failure was the Castle Bravo nuclear test on 1 March 1954. The device achieved 15 megatons of yield instead of the predicted four to eight megatons. Fallout affected parts of the Marshal Islands and irradiated a Japanese fish-ing boat so badly that one fisherman died, causing an international incident (Nuclear Weapon Archive 2006). Though the designers at Los Alamos National Laboratories understood the involved theory of alpha decay, their model of the reactions involved in the explosion was too narrow, for it neglected the decay of one of the involved particles (lithium-7), which turned out to contribute the bulk of the explosion\u2019s energy. The Castle Bravo test is also notable for being an example of model failure in a very serious experiment conducted in the hard sciences and with known high stakes.\nThe history of science contains numerous examples of how generally accepted theories have been overturned by new evidence or understanding, as well as a plethora of minor theories that persisted for a surprising length of time before being disproven. Classic examples for the former include the Ptolemaic system, phlogiston theory and caloric theory": null, " an example for the latter is human chromosome number, which was systematically miscounted as 48 (rather than 46) and this error persisted for more than 30 years (Gartler 2006).\nAs a final example, consider Lord Kelvin\u2019s estimates of the age of the Earth (Burchfield 1975). They were based on information about the earth\u2019s temperature and heat conduction, estimating an age of the Earth between 20 and 40 million years. These estimates did not take into account radioactive heating, for radioactive decay was unknown at the time. Once it was shown to generate additional heat the models were quickly updated. While neglecting radioactivity today would count as a model failure, in Lord Kelvin\u2019s day it represented a largely unsuspected weakness in the physical understanding of the Earth and thus amounted to theory failure. This example makes it clear that the probabilities for the adequacy of model and theory are not inde-pendent of each other, and thus in the most general case we cannot further decompose Equation (2).\n4. \tApplying our analysis to the risks from particle physics research\nParticle physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter and radiation, and the interactions between them. A major experimental method in particle physics involves the use of particle accelerators, such as the RHIC and LHC, to bring beams\n\nJournal of Risk Research \t199\nof particles near the speed of light and then collide them together. This focuses a large amount of energy in a very small region and breaks the particles down into their components, which are then detected. As particle accelerators have become larger, the energy densities achieved have become more extreme, prompting some concern about their safety. These safety concerns have focused on three possibilities: the formation of \u2018true vacuum\u2019, the transformation of the Earth into \u2018strange matter\u2019, and the destruction of the Earth through the creation of a black hole.\n4.1. \tTrue vacuum and strange matter formation\nThe type of vacuum that exists in our universe might not be the lowest possible vacuum energy state. In this case, the vacuum could decay to the lowest energy state, either spontaneously, or if triggered by a sufficient disturbance. This would produce a bubble of \u2018true vacuum\u2019 expanding outwards at the speed of light, converting the universe into different state apparently inhospitable for any kind of life (Turner and Wilczek 1982).\nOur ordinary matter is composed of electrons and two types of quarks: up quarks and down quarks. Strange matter also contains a third type of quark: the \u2018strange\u2019quark. It has been hypothesized that strange matter might be more stable than normal matter, and able to convert atomic nuclei into more strange matter (Witten 1984). It has also been hypothesized that particle accelerators could produce small negatively charged clumps of strange matter, known as strangelets. If both these hypotheses were correct and the strangelet also had a high enough chance of interacting with normal matter, it would grow inside the Earth, attracting nuclei at an ever higher rate until the entire planet was converted to strange matter \u2013 destroying all life in the process. Unfortunately, strange matter is complex and little understood, giving models with widely divergent predictions about its stability, charge and other properties (Jaffe et al. 2000).\nOne way of bounding the risk from these sources is the cosmic ray argument: the same kind of high-energy particle collisions occur all the time in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, on the surface of the Moon and elsewhere in the universe. The fact that the Moon or observable stars have not been destroyed despite a vast number of past collisions (many at much higher energies than can be achieved in human experiments) suggests that the threat is negligible. This argument was first used against the possibility of vacuum decay (Hut and Rees 1983) but is quite general.\n\tAn influential analysis of the risk from strange matter was carried out in Dar, De Rujula, and Heinz (1999) and formed a key part of the safety report for the RHIC. This analysis took into account the issue that any dangerous remnants from cosmic rays striking matter at rest would be moving at high relative velocity (and hence much less likely to interact) while head-on collisions in accelerators could produce remnants moving at much slower speeds. They used the rate of collisions of cosmic rays in free space to estimate strangelet production. These strangelets would then be slowed by galactic magnetic fields and eventually be absorbed during star formation. When combined with estimates of the supernova rate, this can be used to bound the proba-bility of producing a dangerous strangelet in a particle accelerator. The resulting probability estimate was < 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 per year of RHIC operation.10 \n\tWhile using empirical bounds and experimentally tested physics reduces the probability of a theory error, the paper needs around 30 steps to reach its conclusion. For example, even if there was just a 10\u22124 chance of a calculation or modelling error\n\n200\t T. Ord et al.\nper step this would give a total P(\u00acA) \u2248 0.3%. This would easily overshadow the risk estimate. Indeed, even if just one step had a 10\u22124 chance of error, this would over-shadow the estimate.\nA subtle complication in the cosmic ray argument was noted in Tegmark and Bostrom (2005). The Earth\u2019s survival so far is not sufficient as evidence for safety, since we do not know if we live in a universe with \u2018safe\u2019 natural laws or a universe where planetary implosions or vacuum decay do occur, but we have just been exceed-ingly lucky so far. While this latter possibility might sound very unlikely, all observers in such a universe would find themselves to be in the rare cases where their planets and stars had survived, and would thus have much the same evidence as we do. Tegmark and Bostrom had thus found that in ignoring these anthropic effects, the previous model had been overly narrow. They corrected for this anthropic bias and, using analysis from Jaffe et al. (2000), concluded that the risk from accelerators was less than 10\u221212 per year.\nThis is an example of a demonstrated flaw in an important physics risk argument (one that was pivotal in the safety assessment of the RHIC). Moreover, it is significant that the RHIC had been running for five years on the strength of a flawed safety report, before Tegmark and Bostrom noticed and fixed this gap in the argument. Although this flaw was corrected immediately after being found, we should also note that the correction is dependent on both anthropic reasoning and on a complex model of the planetary formation rate (Lineweaver, Fenner, and Gibson 2004). If either of these or the basic Brookhaven analysis is flawed, the risk estimate is flawed.\n4.2. \tBlack hole formation\nThe LHC experiment at CERN was designed to explore the validity and limitations of the standard model of particle physics by colliding beams of high-energy protons. This will be the most energetic particle collision experiment ever done, which has made it the focus of a recent flurry of concerns. Due to the perceived strength of the previous arguments on vacuum decay and strangelet production, most of the concern about the LHC has focused on black hole production.\nNone of the theory papers we have found appears to have considered the black holes to be a safety hazard, mainly because they all presuppose that any black holes would immediately evaporate due to Hawking radiation. However, it was suggested by Dimopoulos and Landsberg (2001) that if black holes form, particle accelerators could be used to test the theory of Hawking radiation. Thus, critics also began ques-tioning whether we could simply assume that black holes would evaporate harmlessly.\nA new risk analysis of LHC black hole production (Giddings and Mangano 2008) provides a good example of how risks can be more effectively bounded through multi-ple sub-arguments. While never attempting to give a probability of disaster (rather concluding \u2018there is no risk of any significance whatsoever from such black holes\u2019), it uses a multiple bounds argument. It first shows that rapid black hole decay is a robust consequence of several different physical theories (A1). Second, it discusses the likely incompatibility between non-evaporating black holes and mechanisms for neutraliz-ing black holes: in order for cosmic ray-produced stable black holes to be innocuous but accelerator-produced black holes to be dangerous, they have to be able to shed excess charge rapidly (A2). Our current understanding of physics suggests both that black holes decay and that even if they did not, they would be unable to discharge themselves. Only if this understanding is flawed will the next section come into play.\n\nJournal of Risk Research \t201\nThe third part, which is the bulk of the paper, models how multidimensional and ordinary black holes would interact with matter. This leads to the conclusion that if the size scale of multidimensional gravity is smaller than about 20 nm, then the time required for the black hole to consume the Earth would be larger than the natural life-time of the planet. For scenarios where rapid Earth accretion is possible, the accretion time inside white dwarves and neutron stars would also be very short, yet production and capture of black holes from impinging cosmic rays would be so high that the lifespan of the stars would be far shorter than the observed lifespan (and would contradict white dwarf cooling rates) (A3).\nThe force of the total argument (A1, A2, A3) is significantly stronger than any of its parts. Essentially, the paper acts as three sequential arguments, each partly filling in the grey area (see Figure 1) left by the previous. If the theories surrounding black hole decay fail, the argument about discharge comes into play": null, " and if against all expecta-tion black holes are stable and neutral, the third argument shows that astrophysics constrains them to a low accretion rate.\n4.3. \tImplications for the safety of the LHC\nWhat are the implications of our analysis for the safety assessment of the LHC? Firstly, let us consider the stakes in question. If one of the proposed disasters were to occur, it would mean the destruction of the Earth. This would involve the complete destruction of the environment, 6.5 billion human deaths and the loss of all future generations. It is worth noting that this loss of all future generations (and with it, all of humanity\u2019s potential) may well be the greatest of the three, but a comprehensive assessment of these stakes is outside the scope of this paper. For the present purposes, it suffices to observe that the destruction of the Earth is at least as bad as 6.5 billion human deaths.\nThere is some controversy as to how one should combine probabilities and stakes into an overall assessment of a risk. Some hold that the simple approach of expected utility is the best, while others hold some form of risk aversion. However, we can side-step this dispute by noting that in either case, the risk of some harm is at least as bad as the expected loss. Thus, a risk with probability p of causing a loss at least as bad as 6.5 billion deaths is at least as bad as a certain 6.5 \u00d7 109p deaths.\nNow let us turn to the best estimate we can make of the probability of one of the above disasters occurring during the operation of the LHC. While the arguments for the safety of the LHC are commendable for their thoroughness, they are not infallible. Although the report considered several possible physical theories, it is eminently possible that these are all inadequate representations of the underlying physical real-ity. It is also possible that the models of processes in the LHC or the astronomical processes appealed to in the cosmic ray argument are flawed in an important way. Finally, it is possible that there is a calculation error in the report.\nIn Equation (1), P(X) is the sum of two terms. The second of these represents the additional probability of disaster due to the argument being unsound. It is the product of the probability of argument failure and the probability of disaster given such a failure. Both terms are very difficult to estimate, but we can gain insight by showing the ranges they would have to lie within, for the risk presented by the LHC to be acceptable.\nIf we let l denote the acceptable limit of expected deaths from the operation of the LHC, we get: 6.5 \u00d7 109P(X) \u2264l. Since P(X) is at least as great as its second term, we obtain: \n\n202\n T. Ord et al.\nP X\n|\n\u00acA P ) (\n\u00acA\n)\n\u2264\n1 5\n\u00d7\n10\n\u221210\n\nl .\n\n( )\nThis inequality puts a severe bound on the acceptable values for these probabili-ties. Since it is much easier to grasp this with an example, we shall provide some numbers for the purposes of illustration. Suppose, for example, that if the limits were set at 1000 expected deaths, then P(X|\u00acA) P(\u00acA) would have to be below 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 for the risk to be worth bearing. This requires very low values for these probabilities. We have seen that for many arguments, P(\u00acA) is above 10\u22123. We have also seen that the argument for the safety of the RHIC turned out to have a significant flaw, which was unnoticed by the experts at the time. It would thus be very bold to suppose that the argument for the safety of the LHC was much lower than 10\u22123, but for the sake of argument, let us grant that it is as low as 10\u22124 \u2013 that out of a sample of 10,000 inde-pendent arguments of similar apparent merit, only one would have any serious error.\nEven if the value of P(\u00acA) were as low as 10\u22124, P(X|\u00acA) would have to be below 0.15% for the risk to be worth taking. P(X|\u00acA) is the probability of disaster, given that the arguments of the safety report are flawed and is the most difficult component of Equation (1) to estimate. Indeed, few would dispute that we really have very little idea of what value to put on P(X|\u00acA). It would thus seem overly bold to set this below 0.15% without some substantive argument. Perhaps such an argument could be provided, but until it is, such a low value for P(X|\u00acA) seems unwarranted.\nWe stress that the above combination of numbers was purely for illustrative purposes, but we cannot find any plausible combination of the three numbers which meets the bound and which would not require significant argument to explain either the levels of confidence or the disregard for expected deaths. We would also like to stress that we are open to the possibility that additional supporting arguments and independent verification of the models and calculations could significantly reduce the current chance of a flaw in the argument.\nHowever, our analysis implies that the current safety report should not be the final word in the safety assessment of the LHC. To proceed with the LHC on the arguments of the most recent safety report alone, we would require further work on estimating P(\u00acA), P(X|\u00acA), the acceptable expected death toll, and the value of future generations and other life on Earth. Such work would require expertise beyond theoretical physics, and an interdisciplinary group would be essential. If the stakes were lower, then it might make sense for pragmatic concerns to sweep aside this extra level of risk anal-ysis, but the stakes are astronomically large, and so further analysis is critical. Even if the LHC goes ahead without any further analysis, as is very likely, these lessons must be applied to the assessment of other high-stakes low-probability risks.\n5. \tConclusions\nWhen estimating threat probabilities, it is not enough to make conservative estimates (using the most extreme values or model assumptions compatible with known data). Rather, we need robust estimates that can handle theory, model and calculation errors. The need for this becomes considerably more pronounced for low-probability high-stake events, though we do not say that low probabilities cannot be treated systematically.\nSome people have raised the concern that our argument might be too powerful, for it is impossible to disprove the risk of even something as trivial as dropping a pencil,\n\nJournal of Risk Research \t203\nthen our argument might amount to prohibiting everything. It is true that we cannot completely rule out any probability that apparently inconsequential actions might have disastrous effects, but there are a number of reasons why we do not need to worry about universal prohibition. A major reason is that for events like the dropping of a pencil which have no plausible mechanism for destroying the world, it seems just as likely that the world would be destroyed by not dropping the pencil. The expected losses would thus balance out. It is also worth noting that our argument is simply an appeal to a weak form of decision theory to address an unusual concern: for our method to lead to incorrect conclusions, it would require a flaw in decision theory itself, which would be very big news.\nIt will have occurred to some readers that our argument is fully applicable to this very paper: there is a chance that we have made an error in our own arguments. We entirely agree, but note that this possibility does not change our conclusions very much. Suppose, very pessimistically, that there is a 90% chance that our argument is suffi-ciently flawed that the correct approach is to take safety reports\u2019 probability estimates at face value. Even then, our argument would make a large difference to how we treat such values. Recall the example from Section 2, where a report concludes a probability of 10\u22129 and we revise this to 10\u22126. If there is even a 10% chance that we are correct in doing so, then the overall probability estimate would be revised to 0.9 \u00d7 10\u22129 + 0.1\u00d7 10\u22126\u2248 10\u22127, which is still a very significant change from the report\u2019s own estimate. In short, even serious doubt about our methods should not move one\u2019s probability estimates more than an order of magnitude away from those our method produces. More modest doubts would have negligible effect.\nThe basic message of this paper is that any scientific risk assessment is only able to give us the probability of a hazard occurring conditioned on the correctness of its main argument. The need to evaluate the reliability of the given argument in order to adequately address the risk was shown to be of particular relevance in low-probability high-stake events. We drew a three-fold distinction between theory, model and calcu-lation, and showed how this can be more useful than the common dichotomy in risk assessment between model and parameter uncertainties. By providing historic exam-ples for errors in the three fields, we clarified the three-fold distinction and showed where flaws in a risk assessment might occur. Our analysis was applied to the recent assessment of risks that might arise from experiments within particle physics. To conclude this paper, we now provide some very general remarks on how to avoid argument flaws when assessing risks with high stakes.\nFirstly, the testability of predictions can help discern flawed arguments. If a risk estimate produces a probability distribution for smaller, more common disasters, this can be used to judge whether the observed incidences are compatible with the theory. Secondly, reproducibility appears to be the most effective way of removing many of these errors. By having other people replicate the results of calculations indepen-dently, our confidence in them can be dramatically increased. By having other theories and models independently predict the same risk probability, our confidence in them can again be increased, as even if one of the arguments is wrong the others will remain. Finally, we can reduce the possibility of unconscious bias in risk assessment through the simple expedient of splitting the assessment into a \u2018blue\u2019 team of experts attempting to make an objective risk assessment and a \u2018red\u2019 team of devil\u2019s advocates attempting to demonstrate a risk, followed by repeated turns of mutual criticism and updates of the models and estimates (Calogero 2000). Application of such methods could in many cases reduce the probability of error by several orders of magnitude.\n\n204\t T. Ord et al.\nNotes\n1. Experts estimate the annual probability as approximately one in a billion (Near-Earth \tObject Science Definition Team 2003).\n2. Scientific arguments are also sometimes erroneous due to deliberate fraud": null, " however, we \tshall not address this particular concern in this paper.\n3. Readers familiar with the distinction between objective and subjective probabilities should note that P(X|A) may be objective or subjective depending on how the report\u2019s argument is constructed, while P(X) has to be interpreted as a subjective probability.\n4. An argument can take into account the possibility that a certain sub-argument is in error. \tWe encourage such practice and look at an example in Section 4.\n5. Between 1982 and 2002, 62% of retractions were due to unintentional errors rather than \tmisconduct (Nath, Marcus, and Druss 2006).\n6.

But demarcation of the problem involves not only the obvious demarcation in \tphysical space and time, but also questions of the systems to consider, the scales to \tconsider, etc.\n8. Additional theories and models can also be deliberately introduced in order to lower the probability of argument failure, and in Section 4, we shall see how this has been done for the safety assessment of the LHC.\n9. The current climate models provide a good illustration (Frame et al. 2007).\n10. Kent (2004) points out some mistakes in stating the risk probabilities in different versions of the paper, as well as for the Brookhaven report. Even if these are purely typesetting mistakes, it shows that the probability of erroneous risk estimates is non-zero.\nReferences\nBloch, J. 2006.

The technology becomes intertwined with an individual\u2019s identity in daily activity. The concept explored here encapsulates the extended-self idea within social identity theory. In this comprehensive review, the idea of shared identity of individuals connecting with AI systems is explored, along with methods, applications, and implications. Assuming that the transition to AI-enhanced society happens ubiquitously, in different categories (e.g., programming, text comprehension), realizing shared identity with AI systems is an important step in societal development. Because identity consists of personal and social experience, the social experience is reflected in global environment, and it in turn extends to the artificial environment. In such layered identity, AI systems act as part of an individual's extended identity, allowing them to navigate digital spaces, share personal information, and interact with various services. The main advantage of shared identity with AI systems is in coordination improvement and task efficiency: people are better at managing tasks when a common identity is highlighted": null, " the same might be assumed for the interaction of a human and AI systems. The application of such ideas is discussed within personal, social and global identities including a new social norm, personification, bias identification, recommender system, social network, ethical considerations, cybersecurity, medical use, and developing a sense of global identity and propose ideas for refining AI Global policy.

On the sunny side of the epidermis are the external or situational forces that press inward on the person, and on the meaty side are the internal or personal forces that exert pressure outward\u201d. \nHumans are biological creatures, we share common ancestors with chimpanzees tracing our genes back to a fruitfly, and algae. Yet, most of our contemporary daily activities are interlinked with technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) systems\u2020. If individuals are becoming more interconnected, should we incorporate he ways that contribute to this connectedness \u2013 language, mobile phones, algorithms \u2013 to become part of our identity? If so, does AI aiming to advance all of humanity must be shared amongst all, just as genes do, in order to be accepted within its humanitarian goal? What about sharing values with artificial systems, such as efficiency and unambiguity? What is our common \u2018skin\u2019 with AI? These are important questions to ponder, but as humanity is underway of becoming intimately connected, with the ability to share and receive any information in almost infinite quantity and in various qualities, these questions need to be addressed. Indeed, sharing identity with AI systems is becoming part of our individual and social identities, which can be viewed and discussed in terms of global environment that under global policy [1], [2]. In this review article, we explore what it means to be sharing identity with AI systems. \n Table 1.

Identity is a two-way process \u2013 it is malleable and dynamic. In cognitive and psychological sciences, self-concept is a part of social identity, which, in turn, describes the idea that individuals with unique personal attributes necessarily share some common traits with others. that define their common social identity [3], [4]. Social identity is also known as social categorization because individuals place themselves into categories when associating with others, i.e., individuals tend to self-stereotype according to the chosen category. Social comparison characterizes the similarity between individuals and describes how people affiliate with others highlighting similar traits. This, in turn, is the base for social communication, \n\u2020The choice to use technology and engage in its complexity is based on availability and preference. \n\nAuthor name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u2013000 \t3\ninteraction and coordination to receive or provide support and feel belonging to a community. These are paramount to social connection, and because being social is inevitable for individual wellbeing. \nAs people change from being psychologically separate individuals, even though physically gathered together, to sharing a common social identity, so changes behaviour. People start attending to each other, talking to each other [5]. According to the theories in social view identity is in terms of a separate individual connected to society within a global environment encapsulating various organisms, which would encapsulate the ability to experience natural and virtual realities. In this article, the idea of different layers of identity extending to AI systems is explored, along with the methods of such connection, its applications, and implications. Three main levels are discussed: individual or personal level of identity, social identity, and global identity \u2013 all which are extended by AI systems (Table 1). \n2.Methods \n Sharing identity with AI systems can be viewed within and extended-self idea. An extended self, like an artificial prosthesis enhances and augments a person's physical capabilities, AI systems enhance a person's interaction with the digital world and manage identity-related information [6], [7].Sharing identity with AI systems is established through several methods, which can be synchronous, asynchronous or mixed (Fig. 1a). \na\na\nb\nFig. 1 a. Synchronous and Asynchronous methods of shared identity with AI systems. \nb. Different layers of shared identities include AI systems, which is versatile and expanding layer. \n\t\t2.1 Synchronous \n\t Synchronous methods of sharing identity with AI systems involve tasks that require real-time user input and interaction. In synchronous methods, such as playing a video character or using an avatar, the user of shared identity experiences the digital environment by sharing AI identity and manipulating the digital environment through it. The idea of shared identity with a synced artificial system is not new and is a well-established feature in video game industry, which is the fastest-growing entertainment industry [8]. In a video game, one takes a game character with specific attributes and acts with it, as if it was self in a separate environment. The distinction between a game character and self is clearly realized \u2013 the character acts as the prosthesis of an individual in virtual reality. The use of an avatar is another example of such a synchronous method, in which a user personalises a character to represent self in digital environment. Additionally, since social media uses various AI systems, one can argue that this is one of the most prominent ways of sharing identity. In the same sense, AI systems, such as health monitoring, even though do not act as a character, but can be perceived as a digital prosthesis, an extended self, in an artificial environment to accompany an individual\u2019s daily digital activities [9], [10]. Cognitive prostheses themselves can be also viewed as synchronous \n\n4 \tAlina Gutoreva / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u2013000\nidentity sharing as they require user input to, for example, facilitate better decision-making in real-time [11]. Chatbots and interactive user interfaces are other examples of such methods. \n\t 2.2 Asynchronous  \n\t\t Asynchronous methods of sharing identity with AI systems involve tasks that can be implemented without the immediate involvement of the user under their permission. Examples of asynchronous methods of sharing identity with AI systems include the transfer of recorded identity-related information, background profiling, or medical records to manage and facilitate the sharing of identity-related data ensuring both privacy and security, whilst performing tasks that require coordination with the user, when they do not interact with the system [12]. \n According to ChatGPT [13] both distributed, decentralized and centralized algorithms can be either synchronous or asynchronous. Authentication and authorization practise, where AI systems provide support and grant access to specific data or services based on user permissions are also examples of both synchronous and asynchronous identity sharing methods. Biometric authentication, user profiling, encryption and anonymization \u2013 all play a role in sharing personal identity and allow data analysis while preserving privacy [14]. Communication, such as instant messaging and tailored news feed can also be considered in terms of both synchronous and asynchronous methods (Fig 1a). \n3.Application \nIn contemporary societies, an individual\u2019s identity is scattered across many domains, including programs, social media and increasingly also within AI systems. The idea of sharing identity can advance the AI ethics discussion, its governance and societal wellbeing. This question can be addressed by exploring the various applications of sharing identity with AI systems, which include (Fig. 1b): \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nGlobal Identity or Global Environment Social Identity \nPersonal Identity or Individuality\n3.1Global Identity \nAI systems are also used provide a better understanding of what is necessary for a thriving global community.As a result of shared identity with AI systems, new social norms, might emerge which in turn will contribute to the development of global identity. Global identity must be based on the idea that developing advanced AI is a challenge for humanity as a whole to work collaboratively as the bounty of doing so is enormous. According to the collective identity view, each individual has I-mode and we-mode, and depending on the moral circle, one can attempt to encapsulate the AI systems into we-mode [15]. Global identity is particularly discussed within the environmental research given global climate change challenges and the necessity for humanity to react to it dynamically as a whole [16]. But, it becomes important within AI governance [17]. The goal within the global identity is either unequivocal (i.e., goal-directed) or hidden (e.g., backpropagation) to not interfere with one\u2019s observations and thus decision process. That is general, collective perception of self requires understanding self in we-mode, which is based on general or global information sharing. By global identity, the global environment is also assumed \u2013 the general reality that with AI system would encapsulate also virtual reality, constituting common environment. \n\t\t3.1.1 \tRecommender system \n\tRecommender systems are a subclass of information filtering systems which play a key role in decision-making processes, which contributes to identity development and sustainability. Indeed, recommender systems are in place of many domains in society's activity, including social media, the music and television industry, shopping, news, and the general search [18]. Many AI systems are employed for recommending products and services at the right time and place to accompany needs and preferences. Indeed, providing accurate recommendations is an important task to ease choice and improve general wellbeing. Decision scientists or behavioural architects worldwide work on appropriate recommendations in different domains, public policy being one [19]. One must be accurate in building a recommender system that would not interfere but guide and predict the goal of an individual, and even adjust the goal to a more \n\nAuthor name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u2013000 \t5\noptimal one (i.e., set vs. growth mindset). The recommender system might also be used as a self-regulation activity, as it highlights specific patterns and biases of the user, which one can explicitly realise. Thus, the recommender system not only reflects user identity but must interact with the user\u2019s identity to provide appropriate service. \n\t\t3.1.2 \tCybersecurity \n\t Cybersecurity is one of the main concerns when it comes to sharing identity \u2013 data that represents an individual must be encrypted, preserved intact, and treated accordingly \u2013 as part of an individual. Data sharing in communication and how much we reveal ourselves directly, e.g., through messaging or indirectly through digital behavioural data is a perpetual way to understand self and receive feedback from others and recommender system. Reasonable care of organizations developing AI systems must be taken in safeguarding individuals when sharing identity from malicious intruders. Arguably social level identities, such as institutions and products that encompass an individual\u2019s experience in cyberspace protect user from mistreatment or errors [20]. Product settings should preserve user\u2019s control of identity through attention whilst using AI systems, to direct mental effort to important tasks [21], [22]. The policy for behavioural and cognitive cybersecurity, mental rules and social norms allow secure connections. For this training for initiating the process will be required. Deepfake detection methods can be used to address the challenge of identity theft and other data losses of individuals [23]. The detection process can be focused on inner consistency detection comparing inner identity with nearest neighbor search (1), using the inner identity of the suspect image, fin, to find its nearest neighbor in the reference set using the outer identity, represented by fout (2).  For this, retrieval of the corresponding outer identity fo\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61 in the reference set and computing the distance to the outer identity of the suspect image is made (3). \n \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b": null, " AI systems could be used to correct and treat malicious predispositions. Polarisation and misinformation, which is the result of biased communication can be persistent and dangerous [40]. Identity as a political association, individual demographics and other factors can be used to describe this bias [41]. Currently, there are several conventional ways to decrease bias: unbiasing individual preferences [42], [43], allowing specialization and expertise associated with diversity, for example, directing highly-emotive content in social media to a more balanced, rational view, and protect highly productive individuals\u2019 confidence and healthy herding, the features that can be used as part of successful global policy. \n4.Implications \n\t4.1 Work-related activities \n\tOne of the main implications of sharing identity with AI is within work. Some jobs will be inevitably lost due to automation, but using AI systems within science, medicine, management, community service and education domains are likely to withstand automation [44], [45]. Sharing identity is necessarily an individual\u2019s contribution to society as a whole with the format determined by the most appropriate contribution given the time, values, environment and individual preferences and predispositions (see Table 1). The social contribution, which is a paid activity, is versatile, meaning that many diverse individuals must \u201cagree\u201d to receive it, which is essential for humane AI systems. For example, online search is arguably one of the most commonly used tools in the world, among messaging, and navigation services. \nBuilding and prompting \u2018global identity\u2019 [46], [47]. As (the first) to realise such identity sharing for work, would be individuals who work directly with AI systems, i.e., AI researchers and developers. Indeed, organisations introduce \n\nAuthor name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u2013000 \t7\na global policy for within corporate strategy promoting global identity, social responsibility cooperation and new economic competition across the teams via official statements and campaigns: \n\u2022\tEmbracing 'AI for society, a human-centred, ethical, and secure approach as opposed to 'AI for profit' and \t'AI for control' [48]": null, " \n\u2022\tProviding foresight for the Global Society [26]. \n\t\t4.2 Ethical Considerations \n\t The transformative potential of general-purpose AI, it can be argued that self-directed fully autonomous agents augment the human experience, that is interfere positively with people\u2019s processes, decreasing suffering and contributing to overall societal well-being and growth. The general purpose nature of AI systems makes it dual-use technology, which is defined as being both beneficial and harmful to humanity [49]. Dual-use also means having simultaneous applicability of AI systems to both commercial and defence domains. If one\u2019s identity is commercial rather than military, sharing it with AI would promote. The convergence of commercial and military applications is the premise by which both firms and the state have a stake in applying AI systems. This, in turn, brings the economic interest of commercial organisations into tension with the national organisations for mitigating security risks. \n\nFig. 2. Willingness to share personal data depends on self-concept (construal). Retrieved from [52]. \n Given the longtermism view and the complex nature of the shared environment, some forms of conflict and even conflict within AI systems just as within human experience are possible before the optimal behaviour within the environment is reached [50]. Such conflict in positive disposition might involve competition instead of war, assertiveness instead of aggression, tension instead of strain, and confronting instead of avoidance. Highlighting the best practices will be necessary for the purpose of increasing visibility and providing common ground for expertise, talent, comprehension, and trust [51]. As in the play, other types of conflict might take place that would contribute to learning. Continuously recording sensor and relevant internal status data, and monitoring might be necessary [52]. Willingness to disclose private information depends on individual differences, which is dependent on self-concept (construal). Individuals who have independent self-construal with a promotion focus are more likely to disclose personal information when presented with gain-framing information as compared to individuals with individuals with interdependent self-construal (Fig 2.) [53]. \n4.3 Medical use \n AI systems could share information with medical professionals for prophylactical reasons or to provide timely help, provide adaptive support that would regulate an individual\u2019s physiological or mental states and help to perform daily activities [7], [54]. For example, if a person is feeling stressed, the AI could appropriately filter and list in an appropriate manner the content of received information. Given the human tendency to alter mental states through activities and substances either to sustain or augment mental activities depending on the goal (or lack thereof": null, " for exploration), dependence is a well-known side-effect, thus medical experts must monitor and highlight predispositions when using AI systems. Medical use of shared identity with AI systems are also considered within neurodiversity domains. AI systems can be also used to direct predispositions of neurodiverse individuals to appropriately use their \n\n8 \tAlina Gutoreva / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000\u2013000\nskills and avoid imposing harm to improve one\u2019s wellbeing within the medical and social standards. An AI system is especially promising for people with disabilities or disorders by adapting to specific patient needs. For example, a recent study demonstrated a brain-computer interface that enabled a paralyzed woman to communicate through an avatar by reading brain activity into synthesized speech and facial expressions [55]. \n5.Conclusion \n One of the challenges of AI research and application is creating AI systems that align with user preferences, needs, and capabilities, ensuring that the technology is an effective and positively transformative extension of humanity. Within shared identity, individuality, social and global identities are realised and the versatile AI system level is advancing other levels. Synchronous, asynchronous and mixed methods exist to enable sharing identity. One of the key reasons for sharing identity with AI systems is understanding the self within the global environment and performing tasks moving closer to individual and social goals that would enable new social norms within AI Governance whilst developing individuality and expertise. With sharing identity comes the accompanying attributes including relatedness and solidarity within humanitarian goals and shared values with AI systems. \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank Pakizar Shamoi for her valuable feedback and advice in preparing this article. \nReferences\n[1] \tN.

Garrick (Editor), Catastrophic and Existential Risk: Proceedings of the First Colloquium, sponsored by The B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences, Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA Luskin Convention Center, March 27-29, 2017. This version 16 August 2017. \nAbstract \nIn the last fifteen years there has been substantial growth in research on existential risk \u2013 the category of risks that threaten human extinction, or the permanent and drastic reduction of humanity\u2019s future potential. A number of new organisations focused explicitly on existential and global catastrophic risk have been founded in recent years, complementing the long-standing work of existing centres focused on specific risk areas such as nuclear war, biosecurity, climate change and systemic risk. This paper provides a brief overview of the emergence of this new research community, and provides a case study on the community\u2019s research on potential risks posed by future developments in artificial intelligence. There exists the opportunity for powerful collaboration between the new approaches and perspectives provided by the existential risk research community, and the expertise and tools developed by the risk sciences for risks of various magnitudes. However, there are a number of key characteristics of existential and global catastrophic risks, such as their magnitude, and their rare or unprecedented nature, that are likely to make them particularly challenging to submit to standard risk analysis, and will require new and specialised approaches. \nExistential and Global Catastrophic Risk \nAn existential risk is one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life, or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development (Bostrom, 2002). For most practical purposes, this refers to developments that might wipe out humanity, or lock us into a situation we (or other intelligent life on earth) cannot recover from, such as a major and permanent global civilizational collapse.1\nThe Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, among other organisations within the existential risk research community, also includes a focus on global catastrophic risks. Here, a common definition is that used by the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute: \nGlobal catastrophic risk is the risk of events large enough to significantly harm or even destroy human civilization at the global scale\u201d ((http://gcrinstitute.org/concept). \nFor this definition of global catastrophic risk, human extinction risks would be a subset of a broader set of global catastrophic risks. However, precise definitions for these classes of risk are less important than having a shared sense of the magnitude of scope of events or developments under consideration, \n1 It is worth noting that Bostrom also considers some more unusual possibilities, such as the emergence of permanent totalitarianism \nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract": "3446663\n\nand the key characteristics of such events or developments. The study of existential and global catastrophic risk restricts us to events or trends that might lead to a full civilizational collapse. It rules out localised catastrophes, and global-scale events that would represent a tragedy but that would not impact our civilisation in the longer-term \u2013 unless these events were likely to play a key role in more severe and permanent cascades and collapses. \nEvents as historically significant as Chernobyl, Hurricane Katrina, the Ebola outbreak, most of our wars in the 20th century, and even the Spanish influenza would fail to constitute global catastrophes or existential threats. For this research community, their primary relevance is in what they can tell us about more severe possibilities within the relevant risk categories. On the other hand, various near-misses during the Cold War (Lewis et al, 2014) might plausibly have led to a global thermonuclear war with global catastrophic consequences, and thus this topic is firmly in scope. \nA clear example of an existential risk is the risk of an asteroid impact on the scale of that which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago (Schulte et al, 2010). An example of a global catastrophic risk that is not existential might include a large-scale pandemic disease outbreak (Palmer et al, 2017", " Millett & Snyder-Beattie, 2017). Research and expert opinion indicates that it is unlikely that a natural pandemic outbreak could wipe out all humans across the globe given our distribution, immune variation, and other factors": null, " and in most plausible scenarios global recovery seems likely in the longer term. \nIt is also important to consider factors that increase stress or resilience on a global scale \u2013 events or developments that in of themselves would not be a global catastrophe, but might make it more or less likely for a global or existential catastrophe to occur. Climate change has the potential to result in global catastrophic consequences at the more severe end of the possibility spectrum \u2013 e.g. 5 degrees and up (Wager & Weitzman, 2016). But we might also consider less severe climate change as a stressor, as it could be expected to lead to major droughts and famines and other resource shortages, mass migration, geopolitical tension that could result in local or global war, and so forth. It could also lead to international conflict, for example over the use of controversial mitigation techniques such as sulphate aerosol geoengineering technologies. \nMore generally, many of the specific risks we will look at need to be placed in the context of a world with a rising population, rising resource footprint, more extreme weather events, increasing pressures on ecosystem services, a changing physical and electronic infrastructure, and changing geopolitical pressures - and a world with a range of technologies more powerful than any we\u2019ve had in previous centuries. \nTopics of focus within the existential and global catastrophic risk research community \nRisks of particular focus within the existential risk community include those relating to our interaction with the global environment (for example, extreme climate change": null, " globally catastrophic biodiversity loss": null, " and risks from natural pandemic outbreaks). They also include risks from scientific and technological advances, such as risks from engineered pandemics and future advances in synthetic biology and other biotechnologies": null, " nuclear winter": null, " and risks from future advances in, and applications of, artificial intelligence. Some focus is given to risks from asteroids and supervolcanoes, but these have been less highly prioritised to date, due to the low frequency of occurrence of the relevant events": null, " the last global catastrophe-level asteroid impact event was the impact that created the Chicxulub Crater 66 million years ago, and the last likely global catastrophe-level supervolcano is thought to have been the Toba eruption 70,000 years ago (Ambrose, 2000). \nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract": "3446663\n\nThe community also has research groups working on global systemic risks, interactions and cascades between risks, risks from future technologies such as neurotechnologies, advances in nanotechnology and other technologies. Researchers also focus on broader or more cross-cutting themes, such as governance challenges associated with global catastrophic risks, ethical considerations relating to the value of future generations, analysis of the costs and value of reducing existential and global catastrophic risk relative to other global priorities, foresight, horizon-scanning and road-mapping exercises for risks and relevant sciences and technologies, and methodological issues relating to reasoning about extreme events under great uncertainty. \nFor most individual global catastrophic and existential risks (with the possible exception of risk from advanced artificial intelligence), there are individual research communities working on these topics", " albeit sometimes focusing more so on risks at a lower end of the spectrum. Some have been doing so for decades. For example, there are many centres doing valuable work on nuclear non-proliferation and security, pandemic preparedness and surveillance, and bioweapon governance \u2013research leaders from these communities are represented at the Garrick Colloquium. There are numerous centres working on different aspects of climate change, biodiversity loss and other environmental risks and resource-related challenges. There are a number of excellent groups working on global systemic risks. NASA, the Planetary Defense community and others work on asteroid scanning and mitigation strategies. Furthermore there are a range of centres in academia, think tanks, government and elsewhere working on more cross-cutting issues such as risk governance and international security, foresight and scenario planning, and so forth. At a level below global catastrophic risk, there is excellent work on risk modelling being done in, and associated with, the reinsurance industry. \nThe existential and global catastrophic risk research community collaborates with, and draws on, research from these communities extensively. It aims to complement such work by looking at existential and global catastrophic risks as a class of risks, with the aim of: \n\u2022\tIdentifying the particular challenges associated with risks of this magnitude - whether they be \tscientific, analytic, ethical, or to do with governance, coordination, planning, or perception. \u2022\tIdentifying risk areas where insufficient attention has been paid to the most extreme scenarios. \u2022\tExamining how these different risks, and other global developments, may interact with each \tother. \n\u2022\tIdentifying previously unidentified or potential future risks \n\u2022\tTrying to distinguish which extreme scenarios are plausible and worthy of further work, even \tif they may be low probability, as opposed to those that can be dismissed as science fiction. \nRecent growth of this community \nThere has been a lot of recent growth within the existential risk research community. The first dedicated centre established was arguably Nick Bostrom\u2019s Future of Humanity Institute (FHI": null, " https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) in Oxford in 2003. The FHI has focused on cross-cutting global \ncatastrophic risk analysis, philosophical analysis on the global importance of reducing existential risk, and in the last decade has placed its strongest focus on characterising potential risks from artificial general intelligence and superintelligence": null, " a lot of this has been in collaboration with the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley. The Global Catastrophic Risk Institute (GCRI": null, " \nhttp://gcrinstitute.org/) in the US was founded in 2011, focusing on risks including bioweapons, nuclear war, artificial intelligence, and natural events, and employing risk analysis methodology. Under Seth Baum and Tony Barrett\u2019s leadership, it has played a key role in establishing links between the existential risk community and experts in these fields. \nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract": "3446663\n\nThe Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER", " http://cser.org) was founded in 2012 by Martin Rees, Huw Price, and Jaan Tallinn, although its first research grants were secured, and first \npostdoctoral researchers hired, more recently in late 2015 and 2016. We now have a research team beginning work on biological threats, extreme climate change, ecological tipping points, catastrophic risks related to future advances in artificial intelligence, and analysis of emerging technologies such as geoengineering. We also have postdocs working on more cross-cutting themes such as horizon-scanning and foresight for extreme risk, responsible innovation in risky sciences and technologies, population growth and resource use. \nThe Future of Life Institute (https://futureoflife.org/) was founded in 2014, focusing on artificial intelligence, climate change, risks from biotechnology, and risks from nuclear weapons. It has organised two highly successful conferences on the future of artificial intelligence and potential risks it might bring, resulting in a widely signed and shared open letter on the responsible development of AI, a grants programme to support work on AI safety, and a set of principles aimed at promoting the beneficial development and application of AI within the research community and more broadly. It has also organised a conference on nuclear war, and has engaged in activities to encourage divestment from nuclear weapons. \nSeveral more recent initiatives are underway within academia, including at Stockholm, Warwick (United Kingdom), and Australia National University, and other world-leading risk centres such as the Garrick Institute (UCLA) are increasingly including global catastrophic risk within their remit, indicating that a diverse range of new expertise will be brought to bear on these topics in coming years. \nWhat can we learn from this research, and what can we do with that knowledge? \nIt is worth considering the insights we can gain from studying risks of this magnitude that may not be gleaned from bodies of work analysing and mitigating risk more broadly, or risks of a lower magnitude. \nOne source of value is simply to be able to rule out scientifically implausible scenarios, in order to better focus our attention on existing threats and plausible future threats. This is of particular value for low-probability, extreme impact events, especially those that may be entirely novel. \nMany researchers argue the value of understanding existential risk on the grounds of their long-term moral significance. If we can demonstrate that certain threats have the potential for human extinction, or permanent collapse, then it is argued that the importance of mitigating them increases dramatically, due to the fact that they would not only harm current generations, but wipe out the potential for a huge number of future lives. \nThere may be specific actions we could take that are designed to mitigate the most severe versions of these threats in particular. These might include establishing a very strict ban on specific types of virus research or bioweapons, or on research on AI systems that could both come up with a realistic model of the world and engage in recursive self-improvement. They could also include seed banks, shelters and alternative foods, so that even in many otherwise extinction-level events we might increase the odds of continuation of the species. \nIn addition, there may be strategies we would avoid adopting unless we had reasonable cause to believe we were headed for a world in which a particular type of global catastrophe were likely. For example, it would be extremely foolish and unconstructive to call for a ban on artificial intelligence research at this point. At some point in the future however, a body of evidence might indicate that certain developments with catastrophic potential are likely within several years. This then might be \nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract": "3446663\n\nreason to consider a temporary moratorium on progress to enhance the capability of AI systems, while various containment and safety measures were being explored. This is not without precedent, even at lower-levels of risk: the US White House issued a temporary moratorium on gain-of-function influenza research several years ago to allow time for more risk-benefit analysis (Lipsitch & Inglesby, 2014). \nOr consider a world in which evidence indicated we were headed for climate change of 5 degrees or over, in the absence of drastic action. In these circumstances we might consider deploying technologies, such as sulphate aerosol geoengineering, which we might be hesitant to deploy under less severe scenarios (Crutzen, 2006). Our reservations might be based on concerns over risks posed by the intervention itself, thorny global governance challenges that the intervention presents, or questions over public acceptance. These may be sound reservations that would rule out these strategies in all but the most exceptional of circumstances. A research community developing indicators that we may be approaching unusually dangerous global circumstances, and developing strategies for last-ditch solutions, may be of considerable value given the risks we may face in the coming century \u2013 even if many of these strategies are never needed or deployed. \nLastly, by studying the particular scientific, governance, ethical, and communication issues that arise when confronting one global catastrophic risk, we can learn valuable lessons to draw on for future challenges. For example, climate change in some ways exemplifies a lot of the issues that make existential and global catastrophic risk especially challenging. There is still a lot of scientific uncertainty over timelines, probability and pathways to the most severe impacts. The scale and impact are difficult to grasp, impossible to see, and the most severe consequences will fall on future generations. We still don\u2019t have broad public acceptance of the science, especially in the US. It involves countries around the world coordinating, each making near-term sacrifices in favour of the longer-term future. Yet the Paris Agreement was extremely encouraging. It involved 194 countries committing to make sacrifices in the interests of future generations in the face of these challenges. Despite the setback of the US\u2019s recent announcement of intent to withdraw, this remains an important achievement and a critical step towards progress on climate change. By learning from the successes and failures of this process, as well as from the history of nuclear non-proliferation and international diplomacy, norms and conventions prohibiting the use of biological weapons, and other global processes to manage and mitigate global risk, we can be better prepared for the future. \nKey challenges in existential and global catastrophic risk \nThere is a large body of expertise from the risk sciences that is of relevance to the study of existential and global catastrophic risk. However, a number of characteristics make these risks particularly challenging to analyse using normal risk analysis approaches. These include the difficulty in estimating the probability and expected impact of rare or even unprecedented events, where there may be sparse data to draw on", " and the changing nature of some risks, in particular those associated with rapidly developing technologies (especially those interacting with a rapidly developing infrastructure). \nFor some global catastrophic risks, probability is relatively straightforward to quantify. For asteroid impacts, for example, we can look to sources of evidence such as the earth\u2019s fossil record, patterns of impact craters on the Moon and on Mars, datasets of asteroids passing our field of vision, and use these to make a reasonable estimate of the frequency with which we might expect an asteroid of a given size to hit the earth. The pathways by which an asteroid impact would result in global catastrophe are also relatively straightforward": null, " therefore we can estimate the expected global harm expected from asteroids of different sizes. \nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract": "3446663\n\nHowever, a similar analysis is much less straightforward for other risks. This can be illustrated by the example of catastrophic climate change. For a start, there is great uncertainty about the sensitivity of the earth system to the effects of our activities. The possibility of severe climate change is affected by factors including to but not limited to the potential for methane release from beneath the melting arctic permafrost, and from the seabed", " how much CO2 the deep ocean can absorb": null, " the possibility of collapse of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets": null, " the possibility that the gulf stream might halt. The most worrying scenarios involve a combination of these factors driving each other as part of a positive feedback loop. While ongoing research will help us understand these factors and their interactions more clearly, it is very difficult to assign a meaningful probability to an outcome such as >5 degree climate change in the 21st century under a certain emission scenario. It may be that attempting to assign strict probabilities is the wrong approach": null, " an alternative would be to develop frameworks of \u2018safe operating thresholds\u2019 with wide error bounds, exemplified by the \u2018Planetary boundaries\u2019 framework put forward by Johan Rockstrom and colleagues at the Stockholm Resilience Centre (Steffen et al, 2015). The expected harm from long-term climate change will also depend very heavily on the extent to which various mitigation and adaptation strategies are adopted, and how successful they are. \nSimilarly, in the case of global pandemics, we we can ask scientific questions about the possibility of the \u2018perfect virus\u2019 with high health impact, high infectivity, and long incubation time. However, the scale and severity of impact will be predicated by many other factors \u2013 movement of humans or other vectors, capabilities of health services, the response of the population, and more. It is plausible that the bulk of the damage might not even be caused by the virus, but instead by a broad infrastructure collapse as emergency services and hospitals are overwhelmed, just-in-time food delivery is disrupted, and other systems underpinning societal order collapse. \nHowever, none of these challenges are insurmountable. Modelling and analysis of factors that contribute to these risks can deepen our scientific understanding. This can help us establish estimates for probability and impact, and in some cases rule out concerns entirely. Where past examples are sparse, there is value in drawing on counterfactual examples of \u2018near misses\u2019, as described by Gordon Woo (Woo, 2016) and others. Design and analysis of scenarios can help in identifying key considerations and interactions. This may help us identify key interventions that reduce risk significantly, even if in instances where it is difficult to assign tight probabilities to events. Other risk analysis techniques, and interventions to mitigate risks at scales smaller that global catastrophe level, also provide a range of useful insights for the analysis of global catastrophic risks, as shown by the work of GCRI and others. \nBy studying global catastrophic risks as a class of risks, we can identify shared characteristics of global catastrophe events, which may help us identify common strategies that aid us in becoming more resilient as a species against a broad set of risks. For example, a number of global catastrophic events (global nuclear war, supervolcano eruption, asteroid impact) would result in large amounts of particulate matter being ejected into the atmosphere, resulting in a disruption of photosynthesis (Maher and Baum, 2013). The development of alternative foods that are not dependent on sunlight, and strategies to scale up production of these food sources rapidly, would be robust in the face of a broad range of catastrophe events (Denkenberger and Pearse, 2014). The maintenance of permanent seed banks, manned shelters suitable for lengthy use, and information vaults represent similar safeguards. Similar strategies, useful for reduction of a broad range of risks, are likely to be feasible at the level of national and international governance (Farquhar et al, 2017": null, " Cotton-Barrett et al, 2016). \nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract": null, " S., J., Dafoe, A., Zhang, B., Evans, O.
